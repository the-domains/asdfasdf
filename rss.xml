            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Drinks: Smoked Manhattan</h1><p>Our good friends at Gin & Luck were kind enough to mix up a giant batch of Smoked Manhattan's for the WC-003 trip.

They won't die even if you cut them in half. To kill one, you must dismember it completely-or inject it with poisonous (to them) bile salts. Instead of braaains, these zombies munch coral, and off the coast of Australia, infestations of the beasts are damaging the Great Barrier Reef at an alarming rate.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/df2ff642b24f92833cf4da9277a687034f647587.jpg"></article>]]></description>
