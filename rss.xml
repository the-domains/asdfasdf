            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Writing a React App with TypeScript</h1><p>For this walkthrough we will still use webpack as our module bundler however now instead of Babel we will be using TypeScript as our transpiler.

There is a great writeup here from the author describing how to integrate TypeScript into a webpack workflow.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/dd676eb5288180859aaa467d8e869a33/noop.jpeg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-images-1.medium.com%2Fmax%2F1200%2F1*--lovgRTM29Fa8psv5GNPA.jpeg"></article>]]></description>
